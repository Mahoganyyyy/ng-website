    <!-- <p style="padding-left: 20%; padding-right: 20%">
        Having worked as a Junior Developer for three years across two companies, I have gained skills and experience in multiple sections of the Development world. 
    </p>

    <p style="padding-left: 20%; padding-right: 20%">
        My career as a Developer started in 2019 when I joined <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mandon-software-limited/about/" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFFF;">Mandon Software</a> as an Apprentice. Over the course of thirteen months I grew from a seventeen year old with no experience in Development, to a nineteen year old with a years worth of experience, countless new skills, multiple professional certificates to my name, and an industry recognised BCS Level 3 Software Development Technician qualification.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20%; padding-right: 20%">
        At Mandon my main responsibility was first to learn, and second, to work with senior developers on a full frontend rewrite of a feature packed and fully customisable Insurance Broker software that is used by Insurance Brokers across three continents. The application is called 'MPACS Web'. This new frontend was built with multiple frameworks including jQuery, Bootstrap, and KendoUI. Throughout my time at Mandon I learned not only the fundamentals of web development, but how to think as a developer. My problem solving skills grew exponentially over the eighteen months I spent at Mandon, and they continue to grow to this day. 
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20%; padding-right: 20%">
        Mandon Software also offered me my first foray into Application Development with Xamarin. I was tasked with creating a Xamarin Forms application that would act as a launchpad for any other software on our clients' computers: a central dashboard allowing the user to quickly access any software they want, including MPACS Web. It was a simple application but it further broadened my knowledge and made me realise that there was far more to development than front end web development.
